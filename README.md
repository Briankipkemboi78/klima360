### KLIMA360 - DATA VISUALIZATION
#### Project Overview
The KLIMA360 platform focuses on addressing the critical challenges of water, energy, and food systems by providing sustainable and resilient solutions. The goal of this project is to support KLIMA360's campaign aimed at farm training, which encourages both beginners and experienced farmers to adopt new agricultural techniques that promote global food security and environmental sustainability.


#### Project Structure
Files:

##### Klima.ipynb: 
This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code used for data collection, initial analysis, and risk profiling. It includes the following:

- Data extraction and preprocessing
- Risk factor identification
- Creation of risk profiles based on farm size, crop types, location, and farming practices

##### KLIMA.pbix: 
This is a Power BI file that contains a visual dashboard. It provides insights into the data collected, including visualizations of farmer segments, risk levels, and other relevant analytics to help the team make data-driven decisions. 

#### Project Timeline:
- Week 1 (October 1–7): Data collection and initial analysis.
- Week 2 (October 8–14): Identification and classification of risk factors.
- Week 3 (October 15–21): Creation of risk profiles and presentation of insights.


#### Tasks:
- Collect Farmer Data: Use available data sources (e.g., government databases, research publications) to gather relevant information on farm size, crop types, and farming practices.
- Identify Risk Factors: Analyze the collected data to determine potential risks such as climate challenges, financial instability, and market barriers.
- Create Risk Profiles: Segment farmers into different groups based on their region, crop types, or other relevant factors. Assess each segment's vulnerability to various risks.



### How to Use
#### Jupyter Notebook (Klima.ipynb):

- Ensure you have Python installed with the required libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib).
- Run the notebook to process and analyze the farmer data, and generate insights into the risk profiles.

#### Power BI Dashboard (KLIMA.pbix):

- Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
- Review the visual analytics and explore different segments of the data to understand farmer risk profiles and trends.
